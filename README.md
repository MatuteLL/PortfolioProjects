# PortfolioProjects

Hi!

This repository holds some of my projects regarding the topics that i found interesting and wanted to dive deeper.

1) Data Exploration and Visualization (SQL and Tableau)
In this project i did some data exploration of a COVID dataset via SQL and found really interesting things, the documents that are part of this project are:
* COVID - Data Exploration.sql
* CovidDeaths.xlsx
* CovidVaccionations.xlsx
